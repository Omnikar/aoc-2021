# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Usage
To build: `cargo build --release`  
To run a solution: `aoc-2021 <day> <part>` e.g. `aoc-2021 day1 part1`

Puzzle input is accepted through stdin, and result is written to stdout.

### Currently completed puzzles
A star (*) next to a day means that there is a revised solution present, which was not
what I used to first solve the puzzle, but what I deem a better solution/implementation
which I came up with after initially solving the puzzle. Revised solutions are accessible
by appending `_revised` to the day, e.g., `aoc-2021 day1_revised part1`.
